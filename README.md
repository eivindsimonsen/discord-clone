## General Information

- If you want to see the clone in action, download the project and run:
  `npm run start`

- The main focus for the code is to test my skills and improve. I was wondering if I would have the skills to code the design of discords of website. I believe I managed to fully design and code the home page, however my react skills are not yet mastered.

## Technologies Used

- Sass - version ^1.52.2

## Project Status

Project is: _in-progess_ / _complete_ /

- The project is considered finished, as the vast size of the website is to much work for me to complete now by myself. I am happy with the home page being created, however it is not fully responsive. I will move on to smaller projects. Might come back at some point to finish the responsiveness of the home page.

## Room for Improvement

Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:

- Making the home page fully responsive
- Better understanding of components and how to use/reuse them.

To do:

- Make homepage responsive
